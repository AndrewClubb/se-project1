        <h5>Where to Start Programming</h5>
        <h6>      </h6>
       
          <div class ="paragraph">
          <p>If you're interesting in certain types of projects, like game creation or artificial intelligence, then do some research on the most common languages used to do those things and start watching YouTube videos or online tutorials of how to work in one of those languages.
            <br>
            <br>
            Projects are a wonderful way to both build interest in creating through programming and to fill out your portfolio when applying for colleges or other opportunities. Try starting small and finding a project that catches your interest, like recreating a simple game you enjoy or automating a task. Small projects like these can get you into the mindset of figuring out how you can use programming to solve problems.
            <br>
            <br>
            If there's a college you are looking to get into, you might want to see if there's a language they use often and start learning it. This could help you understand the curriculum faster when you start classes and help you think through projects more easily.
