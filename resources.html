              Being a computer science major requires you to continuously learn. However, you won't always have professors to walk you through problems. 
              So, who do you turn to once you join the workforce? You will soon find out that Google will be your best friend. 
              The internet is a one-stop shop for any computer problems. Someone, somewhere, has had a similar problem and the solution is out there. 
              So, learning how to best use Google during classes will be the best skill you can learn at college.
              <br><br>
              While Google will help you in your job, websites like LinkedIn will help you get a job. LinkedIn is the professional version of social media. 
              It allows for people and businesses to connect with each other. It also allows individuals to build their online resumes.
              Most computer science companies look at people's LinkedIn pages to learn more about the person. 
              Therefore, building a LinkedIn page while in college is critical to a career after graduation.
