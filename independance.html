              Leaving high school is a big step that comes with a lot of questions.
              <br>Is college going to be harder than high school?<br>
              What kind of job will you have after college?<br>
              How will I balance my free time?<br><br>
              College is the time to learn and grow.
              But college isn't all bad, it is the time to spread your wings and test your independance.
              Professors, mentors, and classmates are always there for you if you are feeling alone.
