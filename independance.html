              Being a computer science major requires you to continuously learn. However, you won't always have professors to walk you through problems. 
              So, who do you turn to once you join the workforce? You will soon find out that Google will be your best friend. 
              The internet is a one-stop shop for any computer problems. Someone, somewhere, has had a similar problem and the solution is out there. 
              So, learning how to best use Google during classes will be the best skill you can learn at college.
