        <h4>The Importance of Mental Health</h4>
        <h6>      </h6> 
       
          <div class ="paragraph">
          <p><b>Take Breaks. Drink Water. Socialize.</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            A lot needs to be juggled while getting a degree, 
            but not allowing all the bugs or blue screens get 
            to you will be the most important thing to keep in mind. 
            Your work is valuable and you can pour your heart and 
            soul into it; but don't forget the need to take a break, 
            drink some water, and socialize with friends and family. 
            It doesn't hurt to take time to stretch and give your mind 
            some time to recoop after working on the same thing for 
            several hours.
         </p>
         <p><b>Don't take everything so seriously.</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Another key thing to maintaining good mental health is knowing
            that it's not always going to be perfect, grades are great to
            keep up but they aren't everything, and it is going to be 
            hard. There will be many ups and downs but we all go through 
            them. Pacing yourself and accepting the hurtles will make the 
            journey an easier one to traverse. Ask your upper classmen for 
            help and don't be afraid to reach out to your peers, as well as 
            your professors; they are more than willing to help wherever needed. 
            Work to the best of your ability and best of luck.
