            A lot needs to be juggled while getting a degree, 
            but not allowing all the bugs or blue screeens get 
            to you will be the most important thing to keep in mind. 
            Your work is valuable and you can pour your heart and 
            soul into it; but don't forget the need to take a break, 
            drink some water, and socialize with friends and family. 
            It doesn't hurt to take time to stretch and give your mind 
            some time to recoop after working on the same thing for 
            several hours.
