        <h6>      </h6>
       
          <div class ="paragraph">
          <p>In almost every field you go into, there will be some team that you will be part of. Being a good team member could almost be considered a skill because it takes work and patience. Every person has their own way of tackling a problem, finding the best way to work alongside others and come up with a solution can be difficult but is pertinent in any workplace. Going into a new team open minded, and leaving behind any ego or pressure on what it needs to look like, will make the entire process a lot more productive and successful in the end.

            <br>
            Teamwork is a critical aspect of life and a skill one has to learn basically no matter what industry they're looking to go into. Each member of a team brings different skills, experience, and personality, making each individual an important facet of a functional team.
